## unsharex

unsharex (unshare eXtended) is a modified version of the util-linux "unshare" utility.

This version of unshare exists for two reasons:

1. The rewrite-it-in-rust brigade knows no bounds
2. More importantly, a multi-step unshare command has valid usecases, and this implements that. See [this upstream issue](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/885).
